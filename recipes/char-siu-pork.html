    <ul>
        <li><b>3 tbsp</b> honey</li>
        <li><b>3 tsp</b> water</li>
        <li><b>0.38 tsp</b> red food coloring</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li><h3>Prepare pork</h3></li>
    <p>Cut the pork shoulder (3 lb) into long slices, roughly about 1 inch thick. We'll aim to cut each slice with uniform thickness so they cook at the same rate.</p>
    <p>Afterwards, we'll repeatedly poke each side of each slice with a fork to help the pork absorb our marinade more effectively.</p>
    <li><h3>Prepare marinade</h3></li>
    <p>To a bowl, we'll add all of the char siu sauce ingredients.</p>
    <p>This amount can be adjusted based on the amount of pork you'll be making.</p>
    <p>Mix the marinade until it's evenly distributed and smooth.</p>
    <p>If you'd like a more rich, red color, you can add a few drops of red food coloring <b>(0.38 tsp)</b>.</p>
    <li><h3>Marinate pork</h3></li>
    <p>Place the meat into a zip-top bag, pour the sauce in, and massage the pork for about 2 minutes so that the sauce is able to finesse its way into the meat. Afterwards, we’ll push all the air out of the bag and seal it. </p>
    <p>Place the bag in the refrigerator, and let the pork marinate overnight, or at least for around 6 to 8 hours.</p>
    <p><b>Chef’s Tip:</b> Do not let it marinate for over 24 hours, or else it will affect the tenderness of the meat. If you refrigerate the pork, let it sit for about 1 hour to bring it to room temperature before starting to cook it.</p>
    <li><h3>Prepare char siu for oven</h3></li>
    <p>Preheat the oven to 425° F or 218° C.</p>
    <p>Set up the baking pan by lining the bottom with aluminum foil (so it's easier to clean!), and place the baking rack on top of the foil.</p>
    <p>Using tongs, start laying out the pork on the baking rack and pan.</p>
    <p>Add 1 to 2 tbsp of water to the bottom of the pan to help generate some steam as the char siu cooks, and to help prevent the drippings from burning and smoking.</p>
    <p>Carefully place it in the oven.</p>
    <li><h3>Roast and baste char siu</h3></li>
    <p>Now, we’ll be removing the char siu periodically to baste it again with either our leftover pork marinade, or honey <b>(3 tbsp)</b> diluted with water <b>(3 tsp)</b>. </p>
    <p>Here’s how my dad split up the cooking time:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook for 15 minutes and baste both sides with the pork marinade</li>
            <li>Cook for another 15 minutes and baste both sides with pork marinade again</li>
            <li>Cook for 10 minutes and baste both sides with the diluted honey</li>
            <li>And finally, we’ll turn the heat up to 450° F, cook for another 5 minutes, baste both sides with honey, and let it cool for a few minutes before cutting into it. </li>
        </ol>
    <p>In total, this is about 50 minutes in the oven. </p>
    <li><h3>Final touches, let cool, cut and enjoy!</h3></li>
    <p>Once the char siu has finished its last cycle in the oven, we'll baste each side with our diluted honey.</p>
    <p>Let the char siu cool for about 5 minutes before cutting into it.</p>
    <p>And finally... enjoy!</p>
</ol>
